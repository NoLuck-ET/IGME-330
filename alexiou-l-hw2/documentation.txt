Improvement over AV HW (I assume pe06?):
 - I would say 15% of 15% for this. I originally wanted an animated gradient, scrolling mountain range, and rainclouds.
	However after spending a LOT of time over break trying to animate the gradient I scrapped it and didn't have
	enough time to do the other things on my wishlist. (I genuinely did not have enough time. I lost sleep trying
	to make my ideas work).

Comments:
 - I require asistance in applying my ideas for the future portfolio piece.
